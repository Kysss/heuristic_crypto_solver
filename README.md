# heuristic_crypto_solver
Crypto solver using heuristics in Prolog

This is crypto problem solver using heuristics, which speed up the process of finding a solution without going through the entire exhaustive search.
See http://cs.oswego.edu/~yxia/coursework/csc366/assignments/hps_essay.pdf for more details.

# Heuristic Used
see document at http://cs.oswego.edu/~yxia/coursework/csc366/assignments/hps_1.pdf

# Execution
call 'demo(N)' to run a collective demo for N random generated Crypto problems.
